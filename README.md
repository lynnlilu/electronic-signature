# electronic-signature
With the outbreak of COVID-19, the electronic signature becomes widely used in various documents. However, users usually take photos of their hard-copy signatures as the electronic ones, which introduces unnecessary backgrounds, further leading to unpretty looks. 

This program aims to provide a automatic way to eliminate the background of users' electronic signatures, so as to make the electronic signatures looking like a hard-copy one.

The initial version only include a Matlab program, and further extension to other program languages are under consideration.
